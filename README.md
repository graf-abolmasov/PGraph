# PGraph

PGraph is a free and cross-platform tool for parallel computation that provides you to construct parallel algorithms in easy visual way and generate source code automatically. PGraph is based on C language and flow chart. We call this combination as Visual-Symbolic Programming Language. Now it is able to generate source code in C/C++ for MPI standart.
